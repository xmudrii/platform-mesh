# Contributing to Platform Mesh IAM Service

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## Project Overview

This is the Platform Mesh IAM (Identity and Access Management) service, a Go-based microservice that provides a GraphQL API for user management and authorization. The service has been refactored to use OpenFGA as the primary backend for authorization data and KCP for multi-cluster resource management, eliminating the need for a traditional database. It integrates with Keycloak for identity management.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Go 1.25.1+ (check [go.mod](go.mod) for exact version)
2. Platform Mesh installation (OpenFGA and KCP)
3. Task runner (optional but recommended)

### Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and configure your IDE to load it
2. Configure required environment variables:
   - `KUBECONFIG`: Path to your kubeconfig file
   - `KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Keycloak client secret (mandatory, read from environment only — never passed as a CLI arg)
3. Other settings (Keycloak base URL, client ID, OpenFGA address, etc.) are configured via CLI flags — see `go run ./main.go serve --help`

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
```bash
# Run locally (configure env vars via your IDE)
task run
# OR
go run ./main.go serve

# Build the project
task build
# OR
go build ./...
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
task test

# Run unit tests only
task unittest
# OR
go test ./...

# Run specific package tests (e.g., middleware/kcp)
go test -v ./pkg/middleware/kcp

# Check test coverage
task cover

# Generate detailed coverage reports
go test ./pkg/middleware/kcp -coverprofile=coverage.out
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

### Code Quality and Generation
```bash
# Format code
task fmt

# Run linting
task lint

# Generate code (GraphQL, mocks, etc.)
task generate

# Generate mocks only
task mockery

# Full validation pipeline (format, lint, build, coverage)
task validate
```

## Architecture

### High-Level Structure
- **Entry Point**: `main.go` → `cmd/` → `cmd/server.go`
- **Transport Layer**: GraphQL API via gqlgen
- **Service Layer**: Business logic in `pkg/service/` and `pkg/resolver/`
- **Integration Layer**: OpenFGA (gRPC client), Keycloak for identity management, KCP for multi-cluster management
- **Data Backend**: OpenFGA for authorization data, KCP for resource management (no traditional database), IDP for User Data

## Development Patterns

### Code Generation
- GraphQL code generation via gqlgen (run `task generate`)
- Mock generation via mockery (configured in `.mockery.yaml`)
- Generated files should not be manually edited

### Authorization Flow
1. JWT token validation through middleware
2. Tenant context extraction
3. OpenFGA authorization checks
4. Role-based permission evaluation

### Multi-tenancy
- Tenant information extracted from JWT tokens
- Tenant-scoped authorization through OpenFGA
- KCP-based multi-cluster resource management

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New GraphQL Operations
1. Update `graph/schema.graphql`
2. Run `task generate` to update generated code
3. Implement resolver in `pkg/resolver/schema.resolvers.go`
4. Add service layer logic if needed
5. Write tests and update mocks

## Pull Requests

You are welcome to contribute with your pull requests. These steps explain the contribution process:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. [Add tests](#testing) for your code.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Make sure the tests pass. Our GitHub Actions pipeline runs unit and e2e tests for your PR.
5. Sign the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO).

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all packages (`*_test.go`)
- High coverage requirements (see [config](.testcoverage.yml))
- Mock interfaces for external dependencies
- Integration testing with OpenFGA and Keycloak

> **NOTE:** You should always add tests when adding code to our repository.

## Technology Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.25.1
- **GraphQL**: gqlgen for schema-first GraphQL API
- **Authorization**: OpenFGA for fine-grained access control (gRPC client)
- **Identity**: Keycloak integration for user management
- **Multi-cluster**: KCP (Kubernetes Control Plane) for resource management
- **Build**: Task (Taskfile.yaml)
- **Testing**: Standard Go testing with testify
- **Logging**: zerolog for structured logging
