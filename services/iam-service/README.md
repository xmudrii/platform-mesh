# Platform Mesh - iam-service
![Build Status](https://github.com/platform-mesh/iam-service/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)

## Local dev

To run the application locally, create `.env` config file from `.env.sample` and run:
```shell
go run ./main.go serve
```

## Description

The Platform Mesh iam-service exposes a graphql and a grpc API. The Graphql API is primarily used by user management UIs, while the GRPC API is used to authorize write calls into OpenFGA.

## Features
- Backend for frontend API's to manage user data
- Write GRPC API to validate write requests into the FGA schema

## Architecture overview
`iam-service`has 2 base layers
- DB 
- Core layer, which is responsible for business logic. It is being called by consumer(or Transport layer) and interacts with all other layers(Hooks, etc.)
Core layers also is responsible for the proper error handling and logging.

## No-Op
If there is no actual implementation for an interface, you can find a no-op implementation in the `./pkg/interfaces/no-op` package. 

## Packages

### graph

This package contains the GraphQL models and resolvers as reusable code. The `graph/platform-mesh.graphql` file contains the schema.

## Getting started

TBD

### DataLoader

To seed Postgresql and FGA store with the initial data, you can use DataLoader job.

This job does 3 things:
1. Imports FGA schema
2. Loads data to FGA store
3. Loads data to Postgresql

#### Prerequisites

1. Postgresql
2. OpenFGA server

#### Golang configuration

Dataloader uses the following fields from the `../intenral/pkg/config.Config` struct:

1. `Config.Database` must reflect your postgresql setup.
2. `Config.Openfga` must reflect your FGA server setup.

#### Quickstart

Dataloader needs the following params:
1. `schema` - path to the FGA schema file (you can find the example in `./contract-tests/assets`)
2. `file` - path to the FGA data  (you can find the example in `./contract-tests/assets`)
3. `tenants` - list of tenants to load data for

##### Terminal

```bash 
go run main.go dataload --schema=$SCHEMA_PATH  --file=$DATA_PATH --tenants=tenant1,tenant2
```

## Releasing

The release is performed automatically through a GitHub Actions Workflow.
All the released versions will be available through access to GitHub (as any other Golang Module).

## Requirements

The iam-service requires a installation of go. Checkout the [go.mod](go.mod) for the required go version and dependencies.
