```shell
go run ./main.go serve
```

## Description

The openMFP iam-service exposes a graphql and a grpc API. The Graphql API is primarily used by user management UIs, while the GRPC API is used to authorize write calls into openfga.

## Features
- backend for frontend API's to manage user data
- write GRPC API to validate write requests into the FGA schema

## Architecture overview
`iam-service`has 2 base layers
- DB 
- Core layer, which is responsible for business logic. It is being called by consumer(or Transport layer) and interacts with all other layers(Hooks, etc.)
Core layers also is responsible for the proper error handling and logging.

## No-Op
If there is no actual implementation for an interface, you can find a no-op implementation in the `./pkg/interfaces/no-op` package. 

## Packages

### graph

## Getting started

TBD

### Dataloader

## Releasing

The release is performed automatically through a GitHub Actions Workflow.
All the released versions will be available through access to GitHub (as any other Golang Module).
