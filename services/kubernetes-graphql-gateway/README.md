The goal of this library is to provide a reusable and generic way of exposing k8s resources from within a cluster using GraphQL.
This enables UIs that need to consume these objects to do so in a developer-friendly way, leveraging a rich ecosystem.

## Overview

This repository contains two main components:
- [Listener](./docs/listener.md): watches a cluster and stores its openAPI spec in a directory.
- [Gateway](./docs/gateway.md): exposes the openAPI spec as a GraphQL endpoints.

## Operation Modes

The system supports two modes of operation:

1. **KCP Mode** (`ENABLE_KCP=true`): Designed for KCP-based multi-cluster scenarios
   - See [Virtual Workspaces](./docs/virtual-workspaces.md) for advanced KCP configuration
2. **ClusterAccess Mode** (`ENABLE_KCP=false`): Designed for support of multiple standard clusters.

## ClusterAccess

For detailed information, see [Clusteraccess](./docs/clusteraccess.md) section.

## Authorization
