// This file holds the release component registry — the single place to edit
// when adding, removing or reordering a release line. To add a component:
//   1. append it to componentOrder (in dependency order — see below),
//   2. add its tag prefix + trigger summary to components,
//   3. if it's a go-gettable library other modules import, add it to
//      libraryComponents so consumers get a `task bump-deps` hint,
//   4. add a row to the usage() table in main.go.

// component describes a release line: its tag prefix (the version is appended
// directly, e.g. prefix "apis/v" + "0.0.1" = "apis/v0.0.1") and a one-line
// summary of what cutting the tag sets in motion — shown in the plan so a
// dry-run makes the downstream effect obvious. Order in componentOrder matters
// for `all`.

// anything that `require`s it, so the published version exists when consumers
// are bumped. golang-commons and subroutines are leaf libraries; apis depends
// on both; the operators and services depend on apis.
