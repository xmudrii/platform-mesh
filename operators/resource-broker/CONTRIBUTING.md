# Contributing to resource-broker

## General Remarks

You are welcome to contribute content (code, documentation etc.) to this open source project.

There are some important things to know:

1. You must **comply to the license of this project**, **accept the Developer Certificate of Origin** (see below) before being able to contribute. The acknowledgement to the DCO will usually be requested from you as part of your first pull request to this project.
2. Please **adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/platform-mesh/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.
3. If you plan to use **generative AI for your contribution**, please see our [guideline for AI-generated code contributions](https://github.com/platform-mesh/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_USING_GENAI.md).
4. **Not all proposed contributions can be accepted**. Some features may fit another project better or don't fit the general direction of this project. Of course, this doesn't apply to most bug fixes, but a major feature implementation for instance needs to be discussed with one of the maintainers first. The best way would be to just open an issue to discuss the feature you plan to implement (make it clear that you intend to contribute).

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they submit the first pull request to this project, this happens in an automated fashion during the submission process. SAP uses [the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).
