2. Be prepared to accept the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) during the pull request process.
3. If you plan a larger feature or architectural change, open an issue first to confirm it fits the project direction.

3. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
4. Verify your changes locally.
5. Open a pull request and address review feedback.

## Development

Prerequisites: Go, Docker, kubectl, kind, and [Task](https://taskfile.dev). See [README.md](README.md) and [docs/CONCEPT.md](docs/CONCEPT.md) for project context.

Key commands:

- `task build` — build the manager binary
- `task run` — run the controller locally
- `task lint` — run formatting and golangci-lint
- `task test` — run the standard local test flow
- `task validate` — run lint and tests
- `task generate` — regenerate CRDs and API resources after API changes
- `task docker-build` — build the controller image
- `task docker-terminal` — build the terminal pod image
- `task docker:kind` — load the controller image into kind and restart the deployment
- `task docker-terminal:kind` — load the terminal image into kind
- `task test-ui` — serve the local websocket test UI

## Pull Requests

- Keep pull requests focused and easy to review.
- Update documentation when APIs, behavior, or workflows change.
- Make sure local verification passes before opening or updating the PR.
- If you change API types, run `task generate` and include the generated output in the same PR.

## Generative AI

If you use generative AI tools while preparing a contribution, you remain responsible for the correctness, safety, licensing, and maintainability of the submitted change.

Follow the org-wide [guideline for AI-generated code contributions](https://github.com/platform-mesh/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_USING_GENAI.md).

If you use Claude while contributing, do not assume it will automatically pick up this repository's `AGENTS.md`. Explicitly provide or reference `AGENTS.md` at the start of the session so Claude has the repository-specific instructions before it suggests or applies changes.
