# Platform Mesh - Extension Manager Operator

![Build Status](https://github.com/platform-mesh/extension-manager-operator/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)
[![REUSE status](
https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/platform-mesh/extension-manager-operator)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/platform-mesh/extension-manager-operator)

## Description

The extension-manager-operator implements the lifecycle management of a Kubernetes CRD `ContentConfiguration` resource, which is a Kubernetes Resource/API for configuration of Micro Frontends in Platform Mesh.

For reference, see the [RFC for Platform Mesh Extension Management - CDM Processing](https://github.com/platform-mesh/architecture/blob/main/rfc/002-extension-content-configuration-processing.md).

## Features
- Support for inline and remote content configurations. 
- Validation of content configuration and generation of a JSON Schema that can be used by contributors to validate their content configuration.
- Services to allow validation of content configuration at runtime while developing a micro frontend on the developers system.
- Ability to provide validation feedback while keeping the last validated content configuration.

## Architecture (KCP mode)

When running with **KCP** (Kubernetes Control Plane) for multi-cluster, the operator uses two separate Kubernetes API configs:

| Config | Source | Used for |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **KCP config** | `KUBECONFIG` env (e.g. mounted from a secret) | Discovery and multicluster provider: watching `APIExportEndpointSlice`, talking to the Root KCP API Server. |
| **In-cluster config** | `rest.InClusterConfig()` | Leader election only: the Lease lives in the cluster where the pod runs. |

So discovery and APIExportEndpointSlice always use **KUBECONFIG**; leader election uses **in-cluster config** when running inside a cluster (same pattern as other platform-mesh operators).

The name of the `APIExportEndpointSlice` to watch is configurable (flag `--kcp-api-export-endpoint-slice-name`; default is omitted so the provider auto-discovers). When set (e.g. to `core.platform-mesh.io`), only that slice is watched.


## Getting Started
For running Platform Mesh locally checkout our [getting started guide](https://platform-mesh.github.io/platform-mesh.org/docs/getting-started). The extension-manager-operator can be deployed on a kubernetes cluster using the helm-chart [here](https://github.com/platform-mesh/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/extension-manager-operator) and for CRDs [here](https://github.com/platform-mesh/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/extension-manager-operator-crds).

## Releasing

The release is performed automatically through a GitHub Actions Workflow. New Versions will be updated in the helm-chart of the extension-manager-operator located [here](https://github.com/platform-mesh/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/extension-manager-operator). There is a separate helm chart for the extension-manager-operator CRDS located [here](https://github.com/platform-mesh/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/extension-manager-operator-crds).

## Requirements

The extension-manager-operators an installation of go. Checkout the [go.mod](go.mod) for the required go version and dependencies.
