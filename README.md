## Description

Platform Mesh is an open, multi-tenant developer platform built on [kcp](https://github.com/kcp-dev/kcp). It provides account-based tenancy, relationship-based authorization (ReBAC via [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/)), search, and UI extensibility on top of a Kubernetes-like control plane.

This repository is the Platform Mesh **monorepo**: it consolidates the shared libraries, operators, services, and tooling that make up the platform. Each component is its own Go module, linked together through the repository-root [`go.work`](go.work) workspace, and released independently via component-scoped tags.

## Components

### Libraries

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [apis](apis) | Shared CRD Go types, deepcopy, and scheme for the `*.platform-mesh.io` API groups. |
| [golang-commons](golang-commons) | Reusable Go libraries (JWT, context, error handling, logging, controllers) shared across components. |
| [subroutines](subroutines) | Lifecycle engine for Kubernetes/kcp controllers with Result-based flow control, conditions, and observability. |

### Operators

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [account-operator](operators/account-operator) | Manages the core `Account` grouping resource and its owned namespace. |
| [backup-operator](operators/backup-operator) | Orchestrates Velero, CloudNativePG, and etcd-druid to back up and restore a Platform Mesh deployment. |
| [extension-manager-operator](operators/extension-manager-operator) | Lifecycle management of `ContentConfiguration` resources for Micro Frontends. |
| [kcp-migration-operator](operators/kcp-migration-operator) | Synchronizes custom resources from existing Kubernetes clusters into kcp workspaces. |
| [resource-sharding-operator](operators/resource-sharding-operator) | Assigns resources to shards via labels so downstream operator replicas filter their watches by shard. |
| [search-operator](operators/search-operator) | Indexes kcp workspaces and accounts into OpenSearch together with OpenFGA permission tuples. |
| [security-operator](operators/security-operator) | Manages security-related configuration (authorization models, identity providers, tuples, stores, invites). |
| [terminal-controller-manager](operators/terminal-controller-manager) | Manages browser-based terminal sessions (ephemeral pods) to kcp workspaces. |

### Services

| Service | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [iam-service](services/iam-service) | GraphQL API for user and role management, driving OpenFGA and the identity provider (Keycloak). |
| [search-service](services/search-service) | REST API to query OpenSearch-indexed resources with OpenFGA post-filtering. |
| [virtual-workspaces](services/virtual-workspaces) | Custom kcp-based virtual workspaces that expose tailored data to UIs. |
| [rebac-authz-webhook](services/rebac-authz-webhook) | Kubernetes authorization webhook backed by OpenFGA (ReBAC). |
| [kubernetes-graphql-gateway](services/kubernetes-graphql-gateway) | Exposes Kubernetes resources as a GraphQL API for UIs and tools. |

### Tooling

Repository tooling lives under [`cmd/`](cmd) — including [`release`](cmd/release), which cuts component-scoped release tags for the monorepo.

## Getting started

Each module can be built and tested on its own, or through the repository-root [Taskfile](Taskfile.yaml), which fans out to every component:

```sh
task build      # build all components
task test       # test all components
task lint       # lint all components
task verify     # lint + test
```

Target a single component with the `<target>-<component>` pattern:

```sh
task build-iam-service
task test-account-operator
task images-search-service VERSION=v0.1.0 PUSH=false
```

The modules are linked through the root [`go.work`](go.work), so cross-module changes resolve against local source during development.

## Releasing

Releases are component-scoped: tagging `<component>/vX.Y.Z` triggers that component's GitHub Actions workflow to build and sign its image, cut a GitHub release, bump its chart, and publish a signed OCM component. The [`release`](cmd/release) tool (`task release`) manages the tag registry and ordering.

## Requirements

Building Platform Mesh requires an installation of Go. Checkout each module's `go.mod` for the required Go version and dependencies.
